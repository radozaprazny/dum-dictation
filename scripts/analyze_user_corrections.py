analyze_user_corrections.py — report on dogfood logs (dogfood_log.py) to answer "is the tool
improving?". Reads commit + user.refix JSONL events, joins by commit_id, summarizes.

Usage:
    python scripts/analyze_user_corrections.py [dogfood/sessions/*.jsonl]
    (default glob: dogfood/sessions/*.jsonl)

Core metric — User Correction Rate = manual char edit distance after commit, normalized by committed
length, over commits where post-commit edit capture worked. Edit capture is best-effort (AX), so the
report also shows COVERAGE; commit-level stats (volume, mishears, by app/repo/flag) are always available.
