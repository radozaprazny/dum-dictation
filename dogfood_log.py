"""
Always-on (opt-in) dogfood logger for the USER CORRECTION RATE metric. Local-only, privacy-conscious.

Default OFF. Enable with HOVOR_DOGFOOD_LOG=1. Writes one JSONL file per session under
dogfood/sessions/ (the whole dogfood/ tree is gitignored — it's your dictation history; delete with
`rm -rf dogfood/sessions`). Two event types, joinable by commit_id:

  commit     every committed dictation: session, ts, cwd, repo_root, app, surface (real bucket via
             classify_surface — terminal/editor/browser/rich-text/unknown), window_title
             (best-effort AX, may be null), mode, raw, fixed, model,
             flags{global_vocab,repo_vocab,fuzzy_symbols,llm}, latency_ms,
             stages_fired[{stage,before,after,ms}] (the embedded correction trace — which pipeline
             stage changed the text and how; the dogfood-analysis source), audio_ref{path,sha256,
             seconds} (Layer-1: pointer to the saved utterance WAV under dogfood/audio/, or null if
             audio retention is off). Derivable fields (changed=raw!=fixed, committed_len, n_words)
             are NOT stored — analyzers compute them from `fixed`.
  user.refix the post-commit behaviour signal (best-effort, BACKGROUND) — answers "did the user FIX
             the output, or move on?". capture_method (ax|keystroke|unavailable) + the AX edit signal
             where readable (edit_distance/normalized/accepted_unchanged + correction_pair, the
             minimal changed-token diff committed->corrected — the learning signal, opt-out via
             HOVOR_KEEP_CORRECTIONS), PLUS (every app) the activity timeline: commit_app,
             app_switches[{t_rel,app}], final_app,
             stayed_in_commit_app, switched_away_s, and a CONTENT-FREE keystroke_summary
             {backspaces,deletes,nav_keys,other_keys} gated to the commit app. AX whole-field reads
             that find an empty field (send-and-clear) are marked unavailable, not a giant edit.

PRIVACY: never logs the whole surrounding document — only the dictated text and a truncated window of
the edited region (REDACT_MAX chars). Keystroke proxy is COUNTS ONLY, never characters. App-switch
timeline is app NAMES only. No network, ever. See DOGFOOD.md.

                     `GitHub`, `web socket`->`WebSocket`). THE learning signal.
      * 'trivial'  — same letters, same word boundaries: an in-place punctuation/case-only diff
                     (`Check.`->`Check`, `Global`->`global`). A real but low-value edit — counts toward
                     the correction rate (the user did change a char) but is NOT a vocab candidate. Also

                     however`): indistinguishable from a legit trim by letters alone, so reported as
                     low-signal rather than guessed either way.
      * 'scramble' — the overlay/AX captured a CHARACTER-SHUFFLE of the same text: letters preserved,
                     sequence/spacing churned (`service SH SSHD`->`Sesvice s SHSHD`, `tool. Uh`->

                     or an AX read taken mid-edit — NEVER a user correction.
      * 'bleed'    — a neighbour commit merged in at an edge (accumulation): the committed text
                     survives intact inside a notably longer corrected text (`Everything else...`->
                     `jumper.Everything else...`). Not a correction of THIS text.
