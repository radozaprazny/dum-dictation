# Architecture

A live microphone stream becomes corrected text in the focused app, entirely on-device. The
flow is: **capture → VAD → recognize → correct → insert**, with optional local telemetry on the
side.

```
mic ─► audio callback (enqueue only)
         │
         ▼
   consumer thread
     energy VAD ──► segments on pauses
         │
         ▼
   Parakeet recognizer (sherpa-onnx, offline transducer, growing window per sentence)
         │  live word-by-word previews + a final transcript at the pause
         ▼
   correction pipeline (ordered stages)
         │
         ▼
   insertion backend (overlay-type or paste at the cursor)
```

The core (`live.py`) is single-consumer by design: the audio callback only enqueues frames, and
one worker thread owns the recognizer, the pipeline, and insertion. If transcription falls
behind, **previews** are dropped — never audio, and never the final commit transcription.

## The engine

Speech recognition is **Parakeet TDT 0.6b v3 (int8)** run through
[`sherpa-onnx`](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) as an offline transducer
(`model_type="nemo_transducer"`, greedy decoding). The model lives under
`models/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/` (3 `.onnx` files + `tokens.txt`) and is
located at runtime by a glob, so the exact directory is discovered rather than hard-coded.

Per sentence the recognizer runs on a growing audio window, producing word-by-word previews as
you speak and a final transcript once the VAD detects a trailing pause. A lock-and-trim scheme
keeps the decode window bounded so per-preview latency stays roughly constant instead of
growing with sentence length.

## The correction pipeline

`pipeline.py` is an ordered list of stages; each takes text and returns `(text, events)`.
Built and ordered in `live.py`:

1. **Punctuation cleanup** — drops the spurious sentence-final marks Parakeet inserts at
   micro-pauses (e.g. `See? this` → `See this`).
2. **Phonetic / phrase-alias correction** — the technical-vocab layer. A shipped global pack
   (`packs/*.aliases`, always on) maps misheard spoken forms to canonical tech terms
   (`engine x` → `nginx`, `cube control` → `kubectl`), plus optional user/repo packs via
   `DUM_VOCAB_DIR`. Aliases are *additive* and word-bounded.
3. **External corrector seam** — an inert boundary where an out-of-process corrector can plug in
   over stdio; disabled unless `DUM_EXTERNAL_CORRECTOR` points at an executable.
4. **Personal-correction seam** — a defined-but-inert passthrough for future per-user learned
   corrections; gated by `DUM_PERSONAL_CORRECTIONS`, no-op by default.
5. **Fuzzy-symbol recovery** — best-effort recovery of distinctive identifiers (gated).
6. **Protected words** — guards canonical forms from being re-mangled.
7. **Sentence capitalization** — re-capitalizes real sentence starts last, after the alias/LLM
   layers may have lowercased a leading word.

There is also an **on-device LLM stage** (`llm_stage.py`): a 4-bit Llama-3.2-1B run via
[`mlx_lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) on Apple Silicon, used for homophone-class fixes
(`grep`/`grab`, `git`/`get`). It is guarded so it only edits when confident and is built lazily
on the consumer thread. Model id defaults to `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit`,
overridable with `DUM_LLM_MODEL`.

## Insertion: overlay vs paste

`insertion.py` defines one narrow `InsertionBackend` seam — the only place text reaches the
screen. Backends do insertion *only* (no recognition/correction/telemetry):

- **Overlay** (`overlay.py`) — types text via synthetic keystrokes word-by-word as you speak,
  reconciling (backspace + retype) on a pause when the corrected sentence differs from the
  preview. This gives the live, growing feel and is used in editors and terminals.
- **Paste** — finalizes the corrected sentence at the cursor via the clipboard at commit time
  (clipboard saved/restored). Used where live keystroke editing would mangle rich text.

`live.py` chooses per focused app: it overlays everywhere by default and routes a small block
list of surfaces that scramble under synthetic keystrokes to paste-at-commit instead. App
detection is handled in `platform_io.py`, which also owns the macOS-native bits (Quartz CGEvent
keystrokes, AppKit `NSPasteboard`, Accessibility reads).

## Telemetry / dogfood seam (opt-in)

`dogfood_log.py` + `events.py` + `activity_monitor.py` form an **opt-in, local-only** seam that
measures how often dictated text gets manually corrected — the signal used to find vocab gaps.
It is off by default at the engine level (the `./dum` launcher turns it on for development),
writes only to the gitignored `dogfood/` tree, and makes no network calls. The optional VS Code
extension in `vscode-dum-telemetry/` closes the editor-coverage gap by reporting post-commit
edits from the document model; it only observes, never inserts. Full detail and the privacy
controls are in [`DOGFOOD.md`](DOGFOOD.md).
