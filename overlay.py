"""
Word-by-word live overlay (Milestone A).

Streams *stabilized* words to the cursor as you speak, then does ONE minimal
backspace+retype "reconcile" at sentence-final to apply the correction pipeline's
fixes (e.g. grab->grep). The hard constraint: we cannot read the screen, only
type characters and send backspaces — so a wrong diff deletes real text. The
design avoids that:

  * During speech we ONLY append. A word "locks" once two consecutive growing-
    window previews agree on it (it sits in their common prefix). Locked words are
    typed and never deleted while you talk -> no flicker thrash.
  * At sentence-final we reconcile what's on screen to the corrected sentence with
    a single cursor-at-end edit: backspace past the common char prefix, retype the
    rest. This also completes any not-yet-locked tail word(s).

The two decision functions below are PURE (unit-tested in test_overlay.py).
OverlayTyper is the thin side-effectful keystroke layer (pynput), with a `dry`
mode that records ops instead of sending them — for safe testing without a cursor.
