"""
Constrained fuzzy alias RECOVERY — SPIKE LOGIC ONLY. NOT wired into the live pipeline.

Goal: recover recognizer near-misses (find model DEER -> find_model_dir, min EDITED script ->
min_edit_script) that the EXACT phrase-alias layer can't catch — but ONLY when the span resolves
to a KNOWN symbol's spoken form. Deterministic, no global fuzzy, no standalone word rules.

Hard constraints (deliberately tight — this is a kill-or-keep probe):
  - multi-word spoken forms only (len >= 2): a single mangled word never recovers on its own
    ("deer -> dir" alone is forbidden; "model deer" ~ "model dir" recovers because "model" anchors it).
  - at most `max_fuzzy` words in the window may be near-misses; the rest must match EXACTLY (anchors).
  - a near-miss = metaphone-equal AND fuzz>=0.45, OR fuzz>=0.80. Pure-exact windows are skipped
    (those are the regular alias's job).
  - target is always a known (say -> want) pair from the loaded vocab; never an open dictionary.

If later promoted to the live pipeline, gate behind HOVOR_FUZZY_RECOVER (off by default). For now it
is import-only and exercised solely by fuzzy_recovery_spike.py.
